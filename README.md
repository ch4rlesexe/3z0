# 3Z0 - Standalone Blog Site

**Demo:** [3Z0.org](https://3Z0.org)

## Overview
This is a standalone blog site that provides a minimalistic and modern layout for blog posts. It primarily consists of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for formatting and structuring the content. 

## Features
- Simple and clean UI for blog posts.
- Responsive design with 'smooth' animations.
- Static site—everything must be manually coded.
- The **contact form** was initially functional but was **disabled** since SMTP was not set up.

## To-Do List
- **Add meta data** for better SEO and social media previews.
- **Implement account registration** to allow user authentication.
- **Enable post reactions** so users can engage with content.
- **Show dates and authors** on blog post cards.
- **Increase the number of posts** for better engagement and content variety.
- **Multi Theme** for more customizability.
- **Local Images** for faster loading.
- **Improve** mobile view.

## Notes
This project is ideal for those who want full control over their blog’s design without relying on CMS platforms. However, it does require manual coding and management.
